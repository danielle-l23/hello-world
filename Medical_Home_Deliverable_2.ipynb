        "## Introduction \n",
        "Our analysis began with making corrections to our previous calculations of ‘The Medical Home’ indicator. We realized we had made a few oversights, the biggest one being that the binary indicators (for example, whether or not a child needs to see a specialist) were not included in the calculation of the final medical home predictor. As well, because we did not remove NAs from our calculation of the mean scores for ‘accessibility’, ‘family-centered’, ‘compassionate’, and ‘comprehensive’, this was resulting in many, many more NA values than was necessary. To correct these scores, we added an additional parameter of na.rm = TRUE for each of the rowMeans calculations for the 4 care categories; this allowed us to create a so-called “valid skip” (per our article) for those patients that did not have a relevant answer to a question about a specific health care need. We also adjusted our scoring, completely eliminating the binary indicators from our scoring system. From this, we received a much more reasonable number of children with a medical home and felt comfortable proceeding. "

        "The left side of Table 4 examines the percentage of all children receiving guidance or screening from a doctor out of those receiving at least one doctor’s visit in that particular year. To start, we pulled out our variables necessary for building the table. To start, we need the variable that indicates whether a person has had a doctor’s visit in the past year. Because the article specified ‘office-based healthcare visit’, and the article focuses on doctors, we chose the variable ‘CHAPPT42’, which pulls data from the CAHPS section of MEPS, which focuses on ages 0 to 17 in the past 12 months. CHAPPT42 is an ordered factored variable, but we are still able to filter for all variables above 0 because those all correspond to positive values. We also took a second precaution to filter by less than or equal to age using the AGE14X variable, the numerical age variable."
